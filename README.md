# IMDBExplorer

* This version utilizes React to replicate the same functionality as the original IMDBExplorer application.
* I didn't have time to recreate the modal in react, so it is still rendered in html and updated using JavaScript. I also would have broken up the functions a bit more. In addition, I would have used Redux for all of the API calls and their results. 
* For me, the most difficult part of React is integrating it into the application using WebPack.
* For students, it could be difficult to understand the structure of React and how state works. Also, the object oriented design of many components may be difficult to grasp for people without much OOP experience.
